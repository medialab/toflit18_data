To look up an unknown wordVersion du 23/03/20160) Golden rule: err on the side of imagination to look up the word, err on the side of caution to decide you have found it!1) try BOTH singular and plural forms in the following sites:• Encyclopédie Diderot/D'Alemberthttp://encyclopedie.uchicago.edu/- use the "Search Terms", not the limited search- check variants as provided by the database. The solution is often provided there.• Centre de ressources textuelles du CNRS: http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/portailCheck in all 5 following categories:- Trésor de la langue française (TLFI)- Dictionnaires de l'Académie (3 versions)- Base ATILFwhich will necessitate five different  clicks on each of the images to the left.2) Use 18th-century dictionaries
• Use the set developed for the project, which can be found
- on the toflit18 Livedrive (ask an administrator for access)
Briefcase/Autres/SourcesVerificationsMarchandises/Dictionnaires XVIIIe-XIXe
- in a Dropbox folder, link below
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jo8s293avwkgom5/AAB16J_HoMhMCqi-b06_6Ms7a?dl=0• Please try several variants in each dictionary, with a simple search (Control-F): most pdf's do find occurrences even though full-text functions are not theoretically available• Basic search: follow the order in which the dictionaries are proposed, from most likely to least likely- set 1: Savary (3 vols.): always use it
- set 2: check at least several. Not all volumes are downloaded, it would be nice to complete the collection through GoogleBooks, where most of these sources are found.
- set 3: only to be used if they seem likely. These are more specialized sources
• other sources (folder Sources diverses): have a look, but the contents of this folder include all positive results from earlier Google searches, so most would be irrelevant.
• specialized glossaries on the web, in the cases in which the description point to a specific type of product:- wood and wood products: the Xycol database: http://www.xycol.net/
3) patois or otherwise regionalized vocabulary:• Check which region the unknown product comes from (which port)- open file base/bdd_centrale.csv
search for occurrence: each occurrence is associated with a source given by call number, year, place and page (e.g. for abafine "AD 44 C 717 … 1774 … Nantes, 6")
- then go to Livedrive (ask an administrator for access)
open Briefcase/Scans (conservation et vérification) (aussi Excel intermédiaires)/[Place name]/[Call number]/[… year].pdf
- check on pdf• Then use the corresponding regional dialect dictionary on the following sites:- http://www.lexilogos.com/france_carte_dialectes.htm(click on the region you are interested in)- other resources there: http://www.liensutiles.org/langueregio.htm4) If all else fails: try a few Google searches, such as "[name of product]", "[name of product] dictionnaire commerce", "[name of product] commerce", "[name of product] 18h century", "[name of product] [plausible category such as toile or bois]", "[name of product] marchandise", etc.
